Hi UniDays people! Hope you enjoy this wonderful program for inserting rows in a database.

# Setup the database
Run the SQL found in `Setup_Database.sql`.

# Tests
There are some unit tests covering areas of validation and automated UI tests covering the overall behaviour of the site, ensuring it fulfills the requirements.

# TODO:
Sorry this has been rushed in the end but here's what I had hoped to get  around to doing:
-	Finish implementing the automated UI tests using selenium. There are still issues around the way it spins up and disposes the web driver. I also have not got around to implementing the steps around checking the feedback response eg: "User has been created" or "Email is required" ect.
-	Make it look nicer. I was going to bring in some bootstrap, or at least make a little effort myself to make the UI look a bit more presentable. Hopefully you can see past that and see that it does indeed function as expected.
-	Probably even more if I take a proper look over it.
